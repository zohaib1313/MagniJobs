  Article 5 of the GDPR requires that personal data shall be:
  ● Processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner in relation to
  individuals;
  ● Collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further
  processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further
  processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific, or historical
  research purposes or statistical purposes shall not be considered to be
  incompatible with the initial purposes;
  ● Adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes
  for which they are processed;
  ● Accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be
  taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the
  purposes for which they are processed, are erased, or rectified without delay;
  ● Kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than
  is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed;
  personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will
  be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific, or
  historical research purposes or statistical purposes subject to implementation
  of the appropriate technical and organizational measures required by the
  GDPR in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of individuals; and
  ● Processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data,
  including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against
  accidental loss, destruction, or damage, using appropriate technical or
  organizational measures.

  applicant with any third party without the express written consent of the
  applicant or client.
  ● Both clients and applicants on the MAGNIJOBS App must consent to the
  accessing of personal information during the job search and recruitment
  process.

  MAGNIJOBS shall maintain a Register of Systems.
  ● The Register of Systems shall be reviewed at least annually.
  ● Individuals have the right to access their personal data and any such requests
  made to Magnijobs shall be dealt with in a timely manner.
4. *Lawful Purposes:*
  ● All data processed by MAGNIJOBS must be done on one of the following
  lawful bases: consent, contract, legal obligation, vital interests, public task, or
  legitimate interests.
  ● MAGNIJOBS shall note the appropriate lawful basis in the Register of
  Systems.
  ● Where consent is relied upon as a lawful basis for processing data, evidence of
  opt-in consent shall be kept with the personal data.
  ● Where communications are sent to individuals based on their consent, the
  option for the individual to revoke their consent should be clearly available
  and systems should be in place to ensure such revocation is reflected
  accurately in MAGNIJOBS’ systems.
5. *Data Minimization:*
  MAGNIJOBS shall ensure that all personal data collected is
  adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for
  which the personal data is processed.

  To ensure that personal data is kept for no longer than
  necessary, MAGNIJOBS shall put in place an archiving policy for each area in which

  shall consider what data should must be retained, for how long, and why.
8. *Security:*
  MAGNIJOBS shall ensure that personal data is stored securely using
  modern software that is kept up to date. Access to personal fata shall be limited to
  personnel who need access and appropriate security should be in place to avoid
  unauthorized sharing of information. When personal data is deleted, this should be
  done so that the date is irrecoverable. Appropriate back-up and disaster recovery
  solutions shall be in place.
9. *Breach:* 
  In the event of a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful
  destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, personal data,

  appropriate, report this breach to the ICO.''';
